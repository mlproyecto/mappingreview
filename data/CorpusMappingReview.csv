A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Teacher Practices in Supporting Student Learning and Engagement in an AI-Enabled Classroom;Karumbaiah, Shamya and Borchers, Conrad and Shou, Tianze and Falhs, Ann-Christin and Liu, Pinyang and Nagashima, Tomohiro and Rummel, Nikol and Aleven, Vincent;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2023;Scopus;450 – 462;13916 LNAI;Research indicates that teachers play an active and important role in classrooms with AI tutors. Yet, our scientific understanding of the way teacher practices around AI tutors mediate student learning is far from complete. In this paper, we investigate spatiotemporal factors of student-teacher interactions by analyzing student engagement and learning with an AI tutor ahead of teacher visits (defined as episodes of a teacher being in close physical proximity to a student) and immediately following teacher visits. To conduct such integrated, temporal analysis around the moments when teachers visit students, we collect fine-grained, time-synchronized data on teacher positions in the physical classroom and student interactions with the AI tutor. Our case study in a K12 math classroom with a veteran math teacher provides some indications on factors that might affect a teacher’s decision to allocate their limited classroom time to their students and what effects these interactions have on students. For instance, teacher visits were associated more with students’ in-the-moment behavioral indicators (e.g., idleness) than a broader, static measure of student needs such as low prior knowledge. While teacher visits were often associated with positive changes in student behavior afterward (e.g., decreased idleness), there could be a potential mismatch between students visited by the teacher and who may have needed it more at that time (e.g., students who were disengaged for much longer). Overall, our findings indicate that teacher visits may yield immediate benefits for students but also that it is challenging for teachers to meet all needs – suggesting the need for better tool support. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.;Conference paper;10.1007/978-3-031-36272-9_37;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85164931249&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-031-36272-9_37&partnerID=40&md5=7ee0cdfe6c2930b92c83c05179b658d2;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Human-AI Partnership; Multimodality; Spatial analytics; Student Engagement; Teaching; Temporality";Analítica/EDM
Counter-factual Analysis of On-Line Math Tutoring Impact on Low-income High School Students;Alhossaini, Maher and Aloqeely, Mohammed;IEEE;2021;Web Of Science;1063--1068;;The importance of understanding on-line tutoring impact has increased dramatically, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, deep causal concepts about on-line tutoring are still lacking, especially on economically disadvantaged students. This paper is an observational study that targets low-income high school students in Saudi Arabia with high failing risk. The paper aims at (1) finding on-line math tutoring impact on needy students who already took tutoring, and (2) identifying and characterizing students that need tutoring to pass. We use observational data collected in a student registration process to build two models: (1) a Bayesian multi-level regression causal model, then (2) a counter-factual model. Results show that the models gave statistically significant estimates. In model 1, the average causal impact of maximum tutoring minutes on the math mark was +4.9 (out of 100). In model 2, the counter-factual maximum impact on tutored students was +5.3. We also estimate that only 1.9\% of students needed the tutoring to avoid failing (2.8\% of the enrolled), and we show their characteristics.;Article;10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00174;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;on-line tutoringcausalitycounter-factualslow-income studentsBayesian inferencemachine learning;Estadística/Probabilidad

Data modeling is an activity that has been proposed to engage students in reasoning about the working mechanism of AI technologies. While Computational thinking (CT) has been conceptualized as critical processes that students engage in during data modeling, much remains unexplored regarding how students created features from unstructured data to develop machine learning models. In this study, we examined high school students' patterns of iterative model development and themes of CT processes in iterative model development. Twenty-eight students from a journalism class engaged in refining machine learning models iteratively for classifying negative and positive reviews of ice cream stores. This study draws on a theoretical framework of CT processes to examine students' model development processes. The results showed that students (1) demonstrated three patterns of iterative model development, including incremental, filter-based, and radical feature creation; (2) engaged in complex reasoning about language use in diverse contexts in trial and error, (3) leveraged multiple data representations when applying mathematical and computational techniques. The results provide implications for designing accessible AI learning experiences for students to understand the role and responsibility of modelers in creating AI technologies and studying AI learning experiences from the angle of CT processes.";Article;10.1007/s10639-022-11355-3;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;AI educationData modelingComputational thinkingIterative model developmentTrial and error;Geometría
An In-Depth Methodology to Predict At-Risk Learners;Ben Soussia, Amal and Roussanaly, Azim and Boyer, Anne;Lecture Notes in Computer Science;2021;Web Of Science;193--206;12884;Nowadays, the concept of education for all is gaining momentum thanks to the widespread use of e-learning systems around the world. The use of e-learning systems consists in providing learning content via the Internet to physically dispersed learners. The main challenge in this regard is the high fail rate particularly among k-12 learners who are our case study. Therefore, we established an in-depth methodology based on machine learning models whose objectives are the early prediction of at-risk learners and the diagnosis of learning problems. Going through this methodology was of a great importance thus it starts by identifying the most relevant learning indicators among performance, engagement, regularity and reactivity. Then, based on these indicators, we extract and select the adequate learning features. For the modeling part of this methodology, we apply machine learning models among k-nearest neighbors (K-nn), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest and Decision tree on a real data sample of 1361 k-12 learners. The evaluation step consists in comparing the ability of each model to correctly identify the class of learners at-risk of failure using both accuracy and False Positive Rate (FPR) measures.;Book;10.1007/978-3-030-86436-1_15;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;At-risk learnersEarly predictionMethodologyLearning indicatorsMachine learningEvaluation;Evaluación/Predicción
Development and Application of an Intelligent Assessment System for Mathematics Learning Strategy among High School Students-Take Jianzha County as an Example;Wang, Guangming and Chen, Xia and Zhang, Dongli and Kang, Yueyuan and Wang, Fang and Su, Mingyu;SUSTAINABILITY;2022;Web Of Science;12265;14;"To improve the quality of mathematics learning for high school students in economically disadvantaged areas, and promote education equity and sustainable development, this study developed the Mathematics Learning Strategies Intelligent Assessment and Strategy Implementation System by using artificial intelligence technology. The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants' diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system's effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students' mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective.";Article;10.3390/su141912265;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"mathematics learning strategies; intelligent assessment and strategy implementation system; high school students; intelligent diagnosis; improvement strategy; mathematics achievements";Evaluación/Predicción
A machine learning approach to investigating the effects of mathematics dispositions on mathematical literacy;Gabriel, Florence and Signolet, Jason and Westwell, Martin;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH \& METHOD IN EDUCATION;2018;Web Of Science;306--327;41;Mathematics competency is fast becoming an essential requirement in ever greater parts of day-to-day work and life. Thus, creating strategies for improving mathematics learning in students is a major goal of education research. However, doing so requires an ability to look at many aspects of mathematics learning, such as demographics and psychological dispositions, in an integrated way as part of the same system. Large-scale assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) provide an accessible and large volume of coherent data, and this gives researchers the opportunity to employ data-driven approaches to gain an overview of the system. For these reasons, we have used machine learning to explore the relationships between psychological dispositions and mathematical literacy in Australian 15-year-olds using the PISA 2012 data set. Our results from this strongly data-driven approach re-affirm the primacy of mathematics self-efficacy and highlight novel complex interactions between mathematics self-efficacy, mathematics anxiety and socio-economic status. In this paper, we demonstrate how education researchers can usefully employ data-driven modelling techniques to find complex non-linear relationships and novel interactions in a multidimensional data set.;Article;10.1080/1743727X.2017.1301916;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Machine learningdata analysisPISAmathematics educationdispositionsdemographicsgradient boostingpsychology;Evaluación/Predicción
Deep Learning Discrete Calculus (DLDC): a family of discrete numerical methods by universal approximation for {STEM} education to frontier research;Saha, Sourav and Park, Chanwook and Knapik, Stefan and Guo, Jiachen and Huang, Owen and Liu, Wing Kam;COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS;2023;Web Of Science;311--331;72;The article proposes formulating and codifying a set of applied numerical methods, coined as Deep Learning Discrete Calculus (DLDC), that uses the knowledge from discrete numerical methods to interpret the deep learning algorithms through the lens of applied mathematics. The DLDC methods aim to leverage the flexibility and ever-increasing resources of deep learning and rich literature on numerical analysis to formulate a general class of numerical methods that can directly use data with uncertainty to predict the behavior of an unknown system as well as elevate the speed and accuracy of numerical solution of the governing equations for known systems. The article is structured into two major sections. In the first section, the building blocks of the DLDC methods are presented and deep learning structures analogous to traditional numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element methods are constructed with a view to incorporate these techniques in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics syllabus for K-12 students. The second section builds upon the building blocks of the previous discussion and proposes new solution schemes for differential and integral equations pertinent to multiscale mechanics.

AI-based adaptive personalized content presentation and exercises navigation for an effective and engaging E-learning platform;Sayed, Wafaa S. and Noeman, Ahmed M. and Abdellatif, Abdelrahman and Abdelrazek, Moemen and Badawy, Mostafa G. and Hamed, Ahmed and El-Tantawy, Samah;MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS;2023;Web Of Science;3303--3333;82;Effective and engaging E-learning becomes necessary in unusual conditions such as COVID-19 pandemic, especially for the early stages of K-12 education. This paper proposes an adaptive personalized E-learning platform with a novel combination of Visual/Aural/Read, Write/Kinesthetic (VARK) presentation or gamification and exercises difficulty scaffolding through skipping/hiding/ reattempting. Cognitive, behavior and affective adaptation means are included in developing a dynamic learner model, which detects and corrects each student's learning style and cognitive level. As adaptation targets, the platform provides adaptive content presentation in two groups (VARK and gamification), adaptive exercises navigation and adaptive feedback. To achieve its goal, the platform utilizes a Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning (DQN-RL) and an online rule-based decision making implementation. The platform interfaces front-end dedicated website and back-end adaptation algorithms. An improvement in learning effectiveness is achieved comparing the post-test to the pre-test in a pilot experiment for grade 3 mathematics curriculum. Both groups witnessed academic performance and satisfaction level improvements, most importantly, for the students who started the experiment with a relatively low performance. VARK group witnessed a slightly more improvement and higher satisfaction level, since interactive activities and games in the kinesthetic presentation can provide engagement, while keeping other presentation styles available, when needed.;Article;10.1007/s11042-022-13076-8;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Dynamic learner modelGamificationLearning stylePrimary school mathematicsReinforcement learning;Tutoría Inteligente
MONTO: A Machine-Readable Ontology for Teaching Word Problems in Mathematics;Lalingkar, Aparna and Ramanathan, Chandrashekar and Ramani, Srinivasan;EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY;2015;Web Of Science;197--213;18;The Indian National Curriculum Framework has as one of its objectives the development of mathematical thinking and problem solving ability. However, recent studies conducted in Indian metros have expressed concern about students' mathematics learning. Except in some private coaching academies, regular classroom teaching does not include problem solving in mathematics, but is limited to mere practice exercises and drills of known exercises. For describing mathematical thinking, Schoenfeld gave a framework containing four components: resources, heuristics, controls and beliefs. Beginning in childhood we develop an ontology for the ideas we learn, and this ontology evolves as we continue learning. Ontologies used for teaching need to incorporate elements of mathematical thinking popularized by problem solving experts. So teaching that makes use of such ontologies of problems, problem solving strategies, and tasks would be beneficial to students. In this paper we identify the gaps in the literature on teaching problem solving, and discuss how and why ontologies can be used for teaching problem solving in mathematics at the high school level. As a proof of concept, we describe the method by which an ontology named MONTO has been created for teaching problem solving in mathematics, and give examples of its use. We describe the MONTO ontology and compare it with some other teaching ontologies described in the literature. We developed and evaluated the MONTO ontology for Surface Area and Volume (3D Solids) problems taught as part of the national curriculum in India, and the results obtained were satisfactory: MONTO was found to be 94\% robust against unseen problems in different curricula for the same domain.;Article;;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Teaching problem solving; Pedagogy ontology; Ontology-based student model; Application of ontology; Knowledge representation";Teaching problem solving

Intelligent system for interactive teaching through videogames;Robles, Diego and Quintero M., Christian G.;Sustainability (Switzerland);2020;Scopus;;12;Education, videogames, and intelligent systems are all relevant topics for researchers. Determining means of improving academic performance using a range of techniques and tools is an important challenge. However, while there are currently websites and multimedia resources that help students to improve their knowledge on specific topics, these lack in not having intelligent agents that can evaluate students and recommend materials to suit the difficulty that a user is having in a given subject. In this sense, this paper aims at developing an intelligent system that allows interactive teaching in basic education using videogames. In particular, high school students' skills in basic mathematical operations with fractions were used for testing experimentally the approach. An intelligent system was developed using computational techniques such as fuzzy logic and case-based reasoning to evaluate user performance and recommend additional study material according to the specific challenges from the given educational game. The use of the games was supported by ICT (information and communication technologies) tools on a web platform. Such a developed platform was tested by 206 high school students, who played 5400 games in total. The students showed an improvement of around 14% in the topics covered. The results indicate that the implementation jointly of videogames and intelligent systems allows users to improve their performance in the given topics. © 2020 by the authors.

DIDACTIC ACTIVITIES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: THE PERSPECTIVE OF STEM TEACHERS;Fissore, Cecilia and Floris, Francesco and Marchisio, Marina and Sacchet, Matteo;Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022;2022;Scopus;11 – 18;;"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) might seem something very distant from the world of schools: a theme that is far from today's reality, especially when the education and training system is committed to tackling the problems associated with the pandemic situation. However, the impact that AI is producing in various areas of our life also requires reflection on the world of education and training. Research and education policies are therefore required to direct education to prepare students for technological challenges, enabling schools and teachers to guide innovation. It is necessary to train teachers not only on the theoretical contents inherent to these themes, but also and above all on the planning of didactic activities to adopt innovative educational approaches. The context of this research is the immersive 3-hour workshop on the theme ""Mathematics and AI"" which involved 52 teachers from all over Italy from primary to secondary school. The research questions are: What is the current teaching practice in schools in Italy in terms of AI? Which characteristics should be emphasized, and which aspects should be favored in the planning of didactic activities by school teachers? To answer the research questions, we analyzed teachers' responses to the initial questionnaire before the workshop and to the final questionnaire at the end of the workshop. Key findings show that teachers do not treat AI-related topics too much with their classes while being aware of the importance of recognizing and understanding AI. © 2022 Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in the Digital Age, CELDA 2022.

CONIC10K: A Challenging Math Problem Understanding and Reasoning Dataset;Wu, Haoyi and Hui, Wenyang and Chen, Yezeng and Wu, Weiqi and Tu, Kewei and Zhou, Yi;Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023;2023;Scopus;6444 – 6458;;Mathematical understanding and reasoning are crucial tasks for assessing the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI). However, existing benchmarks either require just a few steps of reasoning, or only contain a small amount of data in one specific topic, making it hard to analyse AI's behaviour with reference to different problems within a specific topic in detail. In this work, we propose CONIC10K, a challenging math problem dataset on conic sections in Chinese senior high school education. Our dataset contains various problems with different reasoning depths, while only the knowledge from conic sections is required. Since the dataset only involves a narrow range of knowledge, it is easy to separately analyse the knowledge a model possesses and the reasoning ability it has. For each problem, we provide a high-quality formal representation, the reasoning steps, and the final solution. Experiments show that existing large language models, including GPT-4, exhibit weak performance on complex reasoning. We hope that our findings could inspire more advanced techniques for precise natural language understanding and reasoning.

A Machine Learning and Explainable AI Approach for Predicting Secondary School Student Performance;Hasib, Khan Md. and Rahman, Farhana and Hasnat, Rashik and Alam, Md. Golam Rabiul;2022 IEEE 12th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference, CCWC 2022;2022;Scopus;399 – 405;;An essential component of the educational activity is rigorous examination and assessment of students' results, with a potential substantial influence on student growth. This paper offers a predictional model for student's success in secondary education using five classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Naive Bayes, where the data is gathered from two Portuguese school reports and surveys. The two core disciplines (Mathematics subject and Portuguese language) of the dataset were modeled around binary/five-level classification tasks which is imbalanced. The imbalanced dataset is also balanced by using K-Means SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) before classification. The test results reveal that obtaining the most outstanding accuracy value is 96.89% of Support Vector Machine (SVM) is superior to Logistic Regression, KNN, XG-Boost, and Naive Bayes. Therefore, it is essential to consider whether a model makes a particular prediction. Thus, we then train an interpretable LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) model for all the classifiers and the construction of explainable models can have a major advantage: the model can be confident, the transparency of the model helps to understand the underlying processes for working. © 2022 IEEE.;Conference paper;10.1109/CCWC54503.2022.9720806;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85127631449&doi=10.1109%2fCCWC54503.2022.9720806&partnerID=40&md5=91c1f3098f09cdfb7686a5801c1f3a79;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Classification; Interpretable explanation; LIME; Machine learning; Prediction; Students performance";Estadística/Probabilidad

Building on previous research in this field, we propose a group formation method that is based on a combination of course knowledge structures, reading behavior, and assessment analysis to create optimal heterogenous and homogeneous working groups using a genetic algorithm. The characteristics of each group are presented for explanation as a visualized knowledge map showing the strengths and weaknesses of each group, and are in the structure form of curriculum. We also present a case study of applying the method to junior high school mathematics log data, and provide explanation in a visualized form of standardized curriculum of group characteristics that are often referenced for learning design by teachers.  © 2021 IEEE.;Conference paper;10.1109/ICALT52272.2021.00119;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85114891262&doi=10.1109%2fICALT52272.2021.00119&partnerID=40&md5=af7bc796a028132b1dba895dde5ed8d4;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Group information, genetic algorithm, explainable;Pensamiento Computacional
A Novel Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Course for Secondary School Students;Mahon, Joyce and Quille, Keith and Mac Namee, Brian and Becker, Brett A.;SIGCSE 2022 - Proceedings of the 53rd ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2;2022;Scopus;1155;;"We present an overview of a ""Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence""course that is part of a large online course platform for upper second level students. We take a novel approach to teaching fundamental AI concepts that does not require code, and assumes little prior knowledge including only basic mathematics. The design ethos is for students to gain an understanding of how algorithms can ""learn"". Many misconceptions exist about this term with respect to AI and can lead to confusion and more serious misconceptions, particularly for students who engage with AI-enabled tools regularly. This approach aims to provide insights into how AI actually works, to demystify and remove barriers to more advanced learning, and to emphasize the important roles of ethics and bias in AI. We took several steps to engage students, including videos narrated by a final-year second-level student (US 12th grade). We present design and logistics particulars on this course which is currently being taken by ?7,000 students in Ireland.

UNESCO considers as a new vision to involve AI not only as a didactic medium but also as a science in which children can develop their intellect, through workshops, courses, and curricula focused on the fundamentals of AI, allowing them to develop skills such as computational and critical thinking. This research aims to design the DIA4K12 framework, which proposes the structure to support the teaching-learning process of AI in primary and secondary education. The core of the framework consists of four phases: planning, execution, process, and development; three components: open educational resources, K-12 curriculum and active methodologies; five sublevels: logical reasoning, computational thinking, and disconnected artificial intelligence, mathematics for AI, programming and machine learning; and three transversal axes: communities (communities of practice), open license (creative commons) and ethics.

Learning with Interactive Knowledge Representations;Bredeweg, Bert and Kragten, Marco and Holt, Joanna and Kruit, Patricia and van Eijck, Tom and Pijls, Monique and Bouwer, Anders and Sprinkhuizen, Malou and Jaspar, Emile and de Boer, Muriel;APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL;2023;Web Of Science;5256;13;Computers are promising tools for providing educational experiences that meet individual learning needs. However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning.;Article;10.3390/app13095256;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;knowledge representationlearning by modellingscience educationK-12;Evaluación/Predicción

Unlike K-12 science and mathematics education, there is not currently a research foundation for K-12 AI education. In this article we provide a component-based definition of AI literacy, present the need for implementing AI literacy education across all grade bands, and argue for the creation of research programs across four areas of AI education: (1) K-12 AI Learning \& Technology; (2) K-12 AI Education Integration into STEM, Language Arts, and Social Science Education; (3) K-12 AI Professional Development for Teachers and Administrators; and (4) K-12 AI Assessment.";Article;10.1007/s40593-023-00358-x;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;AI educationK-12 educationK-12 AI educationComputer science education;Evaluación/Predicción
Deep learning practice for high school student engagement in STEM careers;Santana, Otacilio Antunes and de Sousa, Barbara Alves and do Monte, Sandra Razana Silva and de Freitas Lima, Mayara Lopes and Ferraz e Silva, Caina;IEEE;2020;Web Of Science;164--169;;The use of deep learning activities at the educational stage is quite relevant for student engagement (positive or negative) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) careers. Physical contact with hardware, visual and interactive contact with software, and contact with algorithms are practices in which students observe the complexity of command could result in ingenious automation and task accomplishment (universal approximation theorem and/or probabilistic inference). Deep learning came to this work as a tool for solving a problem: How do we identify forage palm (Opuntia ficus-indica Mill, Cactaceae) for feeding goats, in an area under Semi-arid climate? High school students on advisory teachers of various disciplines (biology, chemical, physical, mathematics, geography, and others) attempt to answer to this question: Did student engagement happen by new context, problem to be solved, data collection (hardware), or data analysis (algorithm and software)? Sixty-seven high school students from Brazilian public schools (from 14 to 17 years old) participated in the proposed following teacher. High school students get more involved by practical and technological issues (mechanisms and hardware) than in scenario (new context) or by evaluation and discussion of the purpose. This data about the preference of one stage over other stages of Deep Learning determined the application for undergraduate courses in STEM. This was the most relevant data of this work, despite total engagement, students' preferences in one stage point out the student's academic vocation.;Article;10.1109/educon45650.2020.9125281;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;K-12 EducationEngineering CareerProblem-Based LearningEngineering EducationRemote Labs;Pensamiento Computacional
The Dynamic Vectors-Based Attention Model for Chinese Mathematical Term Extraction;Zhong, Maosheng and Kuang, Jiangling and Liu, GanLin and Hua, Xin and Wu, Jiahua;IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS;2023;Web Of Science;12--20;38;Term extraction aims to extract domain-specific terminology from documents. Secondary school mathematics terminology plays a guiding role in the learning and teaching of secondary school mathematics. We found that there needs to be more work in this field and that there are two main issues in extracting the terms from the middle school mathematics text: the polysemy of one character problem and nested terms problem. Accordingly, we have constructed a secondary school mathematics corpus and proposed a model to resolve these problems, termed BERT-LLA-CRF. Using pretraining to obtain dynamic word vectors to improve the model's understanding of text semantics and solve the problem of multiple meanings of one word, the proposed model integrates attention mechanisms and Chinese character information to solve the nested terminology problem. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively solves those problems and achieves good middle-school mathematics term extraction results.;Article;10.1109/MIS.2023.3246240;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Mathematical modelsTerminologyTask analysisData miningSemanticsLatticesComputational modeling;Didactic Activities
A Practical Model for Educators to Predict Student Performance in K-12 Education using Machine Learning;Harvey, Julie L. and Kumar, Sathish A. P.;2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2019;2019;Scopus;3004 – 3011;;Predicting classifiers can be used to analyze data in K-12 education. Creating a classification model to accurately identify factors affecting student performance can be challenging. Much research has been conducted to predict student performance in higher education, but there is limited research in using data science to predict student performance in K-12 education. Predictive models are developed and examined in this review to analyze a K-12 education dataset. Three classifiers are used to develop these predictive models, including linear regression, decision tree, and Naive Bayes techniques. The Naive Bayes techniques showed the highest accuracy when predicting SAT Math scores for high school students. The results from this review of current research and the models presented in this paper can be used by stakeholders of K-12 education to make predictions of student performance and be able to implement intervention strategies for students in a timely manner. © 2019 IEEE.;Conference paper;10.1109/SSCI44817.2019.9003147;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080951846&doi=10.1109%2fSSCI44817.2019.9003147&partnerID=40&md5=ce7f78f9f064b2f268ba910be1411331;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;;Estadística/Probabilidad
Machine learning for high school students;Mariescu-Istodor, Radu and Jormanainen, Ilkka;ACM International Conference Proceeding Series;2019;Scopus;;;In this study, we developed a machine learning method for object recognition that can be implemented using knowledge that high school students attain during their normal math and IT classes. We then tailored a two-hour interactive lesson in which the students were divided into groups to implement solutions to six distinct problems required by the method. The solutions were later put together by the teacher into a working web application (HTML + JavaScript). The lesson was taught on three occasions in Romanian schools to students between 13 and 19 years old. The students were excited about the lesson, and the collected data measuring students' intrinsic motivation suggests that the given tasks and the type of instruction were motivating them. The students also found the lesson achievable regardless the level of their previous programming background. The students were even able to suggest viable improvements to the method. The lesson is presented in short in this (17 minute) YouTube video1. Furthermore, we utilized the developed machine learning tool in a workshop with primary school children.

With nearly 30 million contestants in 63 provinces and cities across the country, the competition has created the joy of learning for tens of millions of students over the past 10 years. Following the success of Violympic, FPT corporation brought the VioEdu Online Education System to the market, contributing to creating fair learning opportunities for students nationwide, promoting the quality of national education. VioEdu is an online training system for elementary, junior high and high school students, helping to personalize their learning, save time and increase learning efficiency by applying the latest technology such as: Artificial intelligence (AI), Big data analysis, graphical knowledge modeling and compatible learning methods. Accordingly, the training process, data on learning behaviors and knowledge of students will be synthesized and analyzed by AI to find strengths and gaps in knowledge to propose appropriate learning pathways. As a result, each skill, depending on the nature, will be cultivated or promoted separately, helping them to learn the right focus and not spread out. The content of the lessons on VioEdu is developed and developed by a team of excellent teachers and educational experts from education departments and universities, following the curriculum of Vietnamese textbooks. In addition, the system also has about 30% of advanced and expanded knowledge. The form of visual lecture presentation, built as a game with encouraging prizes, creates a learning interest for children. Only with computers or mobile devices connected to the internet, students from all over the country can access modern education, shorten the knowledge gap between regions by the VioEdu online education system.

It has a number of features (integration of computer algebra, dynamic geometry, spreadsheet, etc.), primarily focused on facilitating student experiments, and not on formal reasoning. Since including automated deduction tools in GeoGebra could bring a whole new range of teaching and learning scenarios, and since automated theorem proving and discovery in geometry has reached a rather mature stage, we embarked on a project of incorporating and testing a number of different automated provers for geometry in GeoGebra. In this paper, we present the current achievements and status of this project, and discuss various relevant challenges that this project raises in the educational, mathematical and software contexts. We will describe, first, the recent and forthcoming changes demanded by our project, regarding the implementation and the user interface of GeoGebra. Then we present our vision of the educational scenarios that could be supported by automated reasoning features, and how teachers and students could benefit from the present work. In fact, current performance of GeoGebra, extended with automated deduction tools, is already very promising—many complex theorems can be proved in less than 1 second.

SmileyCluster: Supporting accessible machine learning in K-12 scientific discovery;Wan, Xiaoyu and Zhou, Xiaofei and Ye, Zaiqiao and Mortensen, Chase K. and Bai, Zhen;Proceedings of the Interaction Design and Children Conference, IDC 2020;2020;Scopus;23 – 35;;There is an increasing need to prepare young learners to be Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable for the future workforce and everyday life. Machine Learning (ML), as an integral subfield of AI, has become the new engine that revolutionizes practices of knowledge discovery. Making ML experience accessible to young learners, however, remains challenging due to its high demand for mathematical and computational skills. This research focuses on designing novel learning environments that help demystify ML technologies for K-12 students, and also investigating new opportunities for maximizing ML accessibility through integration with scientific discovery in STEM education. We developed SmileyCluster - a hands-on and collaborative learning environment that utilizes glyph-based data visualization and superposition comparative visualization to assist learning an entry-level ML technology, namely k-means clustering. Findings from an initial case study with high school students in a pre-college summer program show that SmileyCluster leads to positive change in learning ML concepts, methods and sense-making of patterns.

Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent sub-fields, the popularity of which is complemented with its high demand as a professional skill for different industries. In the last few years, teaching ML is thus increasingly common in different levels of education. However, the curricula implemented for several courses or programs to learn ML are not always appropriate for the backgrounds of students, particularly high school students, as programming and complex math experience are usually required to implement ML models and understand the potential of this field. For this reason, it is possible for students to have difficulties with the lack of experience required or expected and to have prior to learning ML topics. In addition, motivation can be affected, as the curriculum does not sufficiently engage the student in the learning process. In this work, we propose a visualization tool to introduce high school students to the ML field, which will be implemented using concepts of gamification and adapting the content of the curriculum without requiring exhaustive experience in programming or math.  © 2020 IEEE.;Conference paper;10.1109/ISEC49744.2020.9280629;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85099049734&doi=10.1109%2fISEC49744.2020.9280629&partnerID=40&md5=4da1f49b92a1e812dae25a72144e6e66;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Artificial Intelligence, Education, Gamification, Machine Learning, Visualization.;Pensamiento Computacional
Automated geometry theorem proving for human-readable proofs;Wang, Ke and Su, Zhendong;IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence;2015;Scopus;1193 – 1199;2015-January;Geometry reasoning and proof form a major and challenging component in the K-121 mathematics curriculum. Although several computerized systems exist that help students learn and practice general geometry concepts, they do not target geometry proof problems, which are more advanced and difficult. Powerful geometry theorem provers also exist, however they typically employ advanced algebraic methods and generate complex, difficult to understand proofs, and thus do not meet general K-12 students' educational needs. This paper tackles these weaknesses of prior systems by introducing a geometry proof system, iGeoTutor, capable of generating human-readable elementary proofs, i.e. proofs using standard Euclidean axioms. We have gathered 77 problems in total from various sources, including ones unsolvable by other systems and from Math competitions. iGeoTutor solves all but two problems in under two minutes each, and more importantly, demonstrates a much more effective and intelligent proof search than prior systems. We have also conducted a pilot study with 12 high school students, and the results show that iGeoTutor provides a clear benefit in helping students learn geometry proofs. We are in active discussions with Khan Academy and local high schools for possible adoption of iGeo-Tutor in real learning environments.;Conference paper;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949814140&partnerID=40&md5=1010c969673fdbffe0bf781cb7904d9f;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;;Geometría
Identifying affective trajectories in relation to learning gains during the interaction with a tutoring system;Padrón-Rivera, Gustavo and Rebolledo-Mendez, Genaro;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2015;Scopus;756 – 759;9112;This paper presents the identification of sequences of affective states and its consequential impact to learning in an intelligent tutor for Mathematics at secondary level. These trajectories are represented as time series obtained by DAE 1.0 a software capable of detecting and labeling points in human faces in relation to affective states. Data was collected from students (N=44) in one secondary school, in a semirural town in Veracruz, Mexico. The students were asked to interact with the tutoring system for 40 minutes and were photographed by DAE 1.0 at a pace of 1 picture each 5 seconds. Based on a dataset consisting of 480 pictures per student, we employed the SAX algorithm to make the data discrete and facilitate the interpretation of the time series. The results of classifying the data using ID3 showed an accuracy of 62.85% in identification of affective trajectories related to higher learning gains. Future studies will seek to test this algorithm on a different data set with the aim of predicting performance towards personalizing affective interventions in the tutoring system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.;Conference paper;10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_109;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84949009425&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-19773-9_109&partnerID=40&md5=42038db4d878c6d5498c385924ebca16;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Affective states · Learning · Intelligent tutor system · Time series · SAX · ID3;Pensamiento Computacional
E-learning and classroom learning activities;Jan?a?ík, Antonín;Proceedings of the European Conference on e-Learning, ECEL;2019;Scopus;239 – 246;2019-November;Systems for e-learning or blended learning support of teaching have become an integral part of teaching process from primary schools to universities. There is an enormous number of various LMS systems and educational programmes. Most available systems offer teaching and learning materials and provide feedback to the teacher – information on results achieved by their students. The paper introduces the Techambition system and its potential and opportunities it provides. The system was designed to support mathematics education on upper secondary schools and has been developed by a British company of the same name. This system is used in mathematics education on dozens of upper secondary schools in the Czech Republic. The number of students who work with it exceeds 10,000. Last year Faculty of Education, Charlese University signed a contract with the company Techambition. Academic staff of Faculty of Education are involved in development of educational content. Unlike other product, the Techambition system offers a brand new function – planning teaching activities. A system of artificial intelligence evaluates students’ work and prepares a list of activities for them that the teacher should use in the next lesson. The plan includes both incentives for frontal teaching and proposals for collaborative learning. The system prepares for the teacher not only a set of tasks but also divides the students into groups. When dividing the students into groups, the system uses their characteristics (learning styles, knowledge of the topic, solving procedures used) with the aim of making the group work as effective as possible. Some activities are conducted on-line on computers and having evaluated the results new activities are proposed. The goal of the paper is to introduce the Techambition system as such, the method of designing individual activities as well as pupils’ and teachers’ experience with using the system. Results show that the use of AI in classroom management and lesson planning has a significant potential and deserves attention of further research. © The Authors, 2019.

Modeling Engagement in Self-Directed Learning Systems Using Principal Component Analysis;Hershcovits, Haviv and Vilenchik, Dan and Gal, Kobi;IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies;2020;Scopus;164 – 171;13;This paper studies students engagement in e-learning environments in which students work independently and solve problems without external supervision. We propose a new method to infer engagement patterns of users in such self-directed environments. We view engagement as a continuous process in time, measured along chosen axes that are derived from student data in the system using unsupervised learning (Principal Component Analysis). We construct a trajectory of user activity by projecting the user's scores along the selected PCs at regular time intervals. This approach is applied to a popular e-learning software for K12 math education that is used by thousands of students worldwide. We identify cohorts of users according to the way their trajectory changes over time (e.g., monotone up, monotone down, and constant). Each of the cohorts exhibits distinct behavioral dynamics and differed substantially in the amount of time users spent in the e-learning system. Specifically, one cohort included students that dropped out of the system after choosing very difficult problems that they were not able to complete, while another cohort included students users that chose more diverse problems and stayed longer in the system. In future work, these results can be used by teachers or intelligent tutors to track students' engagement in the system and decide whether and how to intervene. © 2008-2011 IEEE.;Article;10.1109/TLT.2019.2922902;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067817274&doi=10.1109%2fTLT.2019.2922902&partnerID=40&md5=d0af9b3dca2b0ef0832307740b56c7ed;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Educational technology, unsupervised learning,

What’s a textbook? Envisioning the 21st century K-12 text;Ritter, Steven and Fisher, Josh and Lewis, Amy and Finocchi, Sandy Bartle and Hausmann, Robert G.M. and Fancsali, Stephen E.;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2019;Scopus;88 – 95;2384;We present a vision for 21st century digital textbooks, reflecting on Carnegie Learning’s experience as a K-12 curriculum and service provider. After briefly considering the purpose of a textbook, we introduce components of Carnegie Learning’s blended mathematics curricula and consider the inherent tension between providing personalized, individual learning while also providing opportunities for collaborative learning. We then describe a vision for an Adaptive Classroom Environment and a supporting Adaptive Learning Recommendation System to deliver improved learning outcomes based on 21st century digital technologies. While Carnegie Learning has proto-typed facets of both the Adaptive Classroom Environment and Adaptive Learning Recommendation System, this area is ripe for exciting contributions and progress from the artificial intelligence in education (AIED) and related communities of researchers, developers, and practitioners. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

An intelligent tutoring system and teacher dashboard to support mathematizing during science inquiry;Dickler, Rachel;Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics);2019;Scopus;332 – 338;11626 LNAI;Using mathematics is critical to science inquiry at the high school level and is predictive of students’ later success in STEM college majors and careers. Inq-ITS (Inquiry Intelligent Tutoring System) has recently added mathematizing functionalities in order to support students in the mathematical practices needed for scientific inquiry, and our teacher alerting dashboard, Inq-Blotter, is being extended to alert teachers in real-time to students’ difficulties with this practice. Mathematizing in science can be challenging as students must attend to multiple sources of information (i.e., graphs, data tables), as well as do graphing and modeling. In the present paper, I describe three studies on the use of Inq-Blotter to support students on mathematizing in which I: (1) explore students’ eye-movements and think-aloud protocols while mathematizing in Inq-ITS to identify the proportion of mathematizing difficulties that are related to knowledge acquisition processes versus other mathematical competencies (e.g., graph building and modeling), (2) examine if alerts within Inq-Blotter permit teachers to identify students who need help most (relative to teachers without access to alerts), and (3) identify whether teacher support based on alerts leads to improvements on students’ next opportunity to engage in mathematizing and examine the corresponding teacher discourse associated with students’ gains. These studies will indicate how to support students on mathematizing with intelligent technologies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.;Conference paper;10.1007/978-3-030-23207-8_61;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068326556&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-030-23207-8_61&partnerID=40&md5=e78f02218638ff11219b89e6f8d08d0a;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Intelligent tutoring

Dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system used in agent-based intelligent tutoring system;Khosravifar, Babak and Cuevas, Clemente and Bentahar, Jamal;2018 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and Applied Computing, CSCE 2018 - Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2018;2018;Scopus;352 – 358;;Peer-to-peer tutoring in high schools are increasingly used to model a dynamic learning environment where students can effectively teach and learn by improving self-regulatory skills. We propose a dynamic peer-to-peer amplifier system in the form of a mathematical framework for a recommender system that addresses the problem of formulating response phrases for the tutoring considering the underlying sequence of possible phrases. Ultimately, using the recommended phrases, the peer tutor becomes more professional in teaching math problems to peer students. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it is adaptive to the peer student’s concentration level and accordingly recommends phrases to the peer tutor while considering the sequence of communication took place in the session combined with the reflection on peer student’s concentration level. Improving the quality of education via peer-to-peer training has been a challenge for a while and in this paper, we attempt to address the problem by using AI techniques to generate phrases in the form of recommendations to the students who tutor peers having difficulty with similar problems. We propose a recommender sequence mapping system to effectively recommend new phrases that are meaningful and goal-oriented given the past sequence of communication. Evaluation of the approach on the Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) curves shows that the proposed recommender system is highly robust and accurately learns parameters in various settings. Given that there is no system to be used as benchmark, we managed to compare the system with and without deployment of the Al-empowered recommender framework and discuss the system performance in various aspects.

Multi-models of educational data mining for predicting student performance in mathematics: A case study on high schools in cambodia;Sokkhey, Phauk and Navy, Sin and Tong, Ly and Okazaki, Takeo;IEIE Transactions on Smart Processing and Computing;2020;Scopus;217 – 229;9;Education is crucial for the development of any country. Analysis of education datasets requires effective algorithms to extract hidden information and gain the fruitful results to improve academic performance. Multiple models were used to maximize the contribution to the education environment. In this study, we used the spot-checking algorithm to compare these methods and find the most effective method. We propose three main classes of education research tools: A statistical analysis method, machine learning algorithms, and a deep learning framework. The data were obtained from many high schools in Cambodia. We introduced feature selection techniques to figure out the informative features that affect the future performance of students in mathematics. The proposed ensemble methods of tree-based classifiers provide satisfiying results, and in that, random forest algorithm generates the highest accuracy and the lowest predictive mean squared error, thus showing potential in this prediction and classification problem. The results from this work can be used as recipe and recommendation for mining various material settings in improving high school student performance in Cambodia. © 2020 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers.

ML4STEM Professional Development Program: Enriching K-12 STEM Teaching with Machine Learning;Tang, Jingwan and Zhou, Xiaofei and Wan, Xiaoyu and Daley, Michael and Bai, Zhen;International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education;2023;Scopus;185 – 224;33;The advances of machine learning (ML) in scientific discovery (SD) reveal exciting opportunities to utilize it as a cross-cutting tool for inquiry-based learning in K-12 STEM classrooms. There are, however, limited efforts on providing teachers with sufficient knowledge and skills to integrate ML into teaching. Our study addresses this gap by proposing a professional development (PD) program named ML4STEM. Based on existing research on supporting teacher learning in innovative technology integration, ML4STEM is composed of Teachers-as-Learners and Teachers-as-Designers sessions. It integrates an accessible ML learning platform designed for students with limited math and computing skills. We implemented this PD program and evaluated its effectiveness with 18 K-12 STEM teachers. Findings confirm that ML4STEM successfully develops teachers’ understanding of teaching STEM with ML as well as fosters positive attitudes toward applying the ML as an in-class teaching technology. Discussions on the implications of our findings from ML4STEM are provided for future PD researchers and designers. © 2022, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.;Article;10.1007/s40593-022-00292-4;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85128216180&doi=10.1007%2fs40593-022-00292-4&partnerID=40&md5=176e01d5fcffe4cdb6685b1a64a9f8c7;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"K-12 STEM teaching; Machine learning; ML4STEM; Professional development program";Didactic Activities
Construction of teacher-student interaction evaluation index system for high school mathematics concept assimilation learning based on artificial intelligence;Zhen, Yiming and Shi, Sumeng and Wang, Wei and Wang, Guangming;Artificial Intelligence in Education and Teaching Assessment;2022;Scopus;125 – 148;;Teacher-student interaction is one of the most critical teaching behaviors in high school mathematics classrooms. As one of the main parts of mathematics teaching, concepts are the core of mathematics knowledge. Moreover, concept assimilation is the essential learning approach for senior students to acquire mathematics concepts. Therefore, this study constructed the Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning. Combining both qualitative and quantitative perspectives, this study first constructed the evaluation system from the theoretical perspective using the Delphi method. Then, the video analysis was used to verify the evaluation system by conducting a qualitative analysis of high-quality teaching videos from the practical perspective with the help of artificial intelligence. Teacher-Student Interaction Evaluation Index System for High School Mathematics Concept Assimilation Learning constructed in this study included four first-level indicators: teacher-student interaction in the concept recognition stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept processing stage, teacher-student interaction in the concept reinforcement stage, and teacher-student interaction in the concept application stage, and eight second-level indicators: mutual communication, mobilizing learning initiative, explanation and exploration, inspired focus, example analysis, inspiration and concentration, task solving, and encouragement and feedback. This study could provide quantitative evaluation tools and theoretical models for teacher-student interaction in concept assimilation learning, and enrich teachers' understanding of concept teaching theory and teacher-student interaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.;Book chapter;10.1007/978-981-16-6502-8_13;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152548248&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-16-6502-8_13&partnerID=40&md5=c5201745be4786dc4a4b42f7d6be2d22;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Artificial intelligence; Concept assimilation; Evaluation model; Facial recognition; Qualitative analysis; Speech recognition; Teacher-student interaction";Evaluación/Predicción
Feedback in Online Mathematics Tutoring;Jan?a?ík, Antonín and Michal, Jakub and Novotná, Jarmila;International Conference on Computer Supported Education, CSEDU - Proceedings;2023;Scopus;374 – 381;1;The goal of this paper is to present issues related to assessment and feedback in the framework of online mathematics tutoring implemented with the help of a chatbot using Artificial intelligence (AI) (Jan?a?ík et al., 2022).

Development and Application of an Intelligent Assessment System for Mathematics Learning Strategy among High School Students—Take Jianzha County as an Example;Wang, Guangming and Chen, Xia and Zhang, Dongli and Kang, Yueyuan and Wang, Fang and Su, Mingyu;Sustainability (Switzerland);2022;Scopus;;14;"To improve the quality of mathematics learning for high school students in economically disadvantaged areas, and promote education equity and sustainable development, this study developed the Mathematics Learning Strategies Intelligent Assessment and Strategy Implementation System by using artificial intelligence technology. The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants’ diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system’s effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students’ mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective. © 2022 by the authors.";Article;10.3390/su141912265;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85139944328&doi=10.3390%2fsu141912265&partnerID=40&md5=0e199c98f2697ce68d7e9e3475689ade;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"high school students; improvement strategy; intelligent assessment and strategy implementation system; intelligent diagnosis; mathematics achievements; mathematics learning strategies";Evaluación/Predicción

Toward learning progression analytics — Developing learning environments for the automated analysis of learning using evidence centered design;Kubsch, Marcus and Czinczel, Berrit and Lossjew, Jannik and Wyrwich, Tobias and Bednorz, David and Bernholt, Sascha and Fiedler, Daniela and Strauß, Sebastian and Cress, Ulrike and Drachsler, Hendrik and Neumann, Knut and Rummel, Nikol;Frontiers in Education;2022;Scopus;;7;National educational standards stress the importance of science and mathematics learning for today’s students. However, across disciplines, students frequently struggle to meet learning goals about core concepts like energy. Digital learning environments enhanced with artificial intelligence hold the promise to address this issue by providing individualized instruction and support for students at scale. Scaffolding and feedback, for example, are both most effective when tailored to students’ needs. Providing individualized instruction requires continuous assessment of students’ individual knowledge, abilities, and skills in a way that is meaningful for providing tailored support and planning further instruction. While continuously assessing individual students’ science and mathematics learning is challenging, intelligent tutoring systems show that it is feasible in principle. However, the learning environments in intelligent tutoring systems are typically not compatible with the vision of how effective K-12 science and mathematics learning looks like. This leads to the challenge of designing digital learning environments that allow for both – meaningful science and mathematics learning and the reliable and valid assessment of individual students’ learning. Today, digital devices such as tablets, laptops, or digital measurement systems increasingly enter science and mathematics classrooms. In consequence, students’ learning increasingly produces rich product and process data. Learning Analytics techniques can help to automatically analyze this data in order to obtain insights about individual students’ learning, drawing on general theories of learning and relative to established domain specific models of learning, i.e., learning progressions. We call this approach Learning Progression Analytics (LPA). In this manuscript, building of evidence-centered design (ECD), we develop a framework to guide the development of learning environments that provide meaningful learning activities and data for the automated analysis of individual students’ learning – the basis for LPA and scaling individualized instruction with artificial intelligence.

Machine learning prediction and analysis of students’ academic performance;Pasic, Mirza and Vatres, Ajdin and Ferizbegovic, Faris and Bajric, Hadis and Pasic, Mugdim;Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences;2023;Scopus;27 – 46;11;Analyzing students’ academic performance is important for evaluating enrollment criteria which establish the standards required for pupils who finished secondary school to gain admission to a higher education institution. The aims of this research were to develop a machine learning prediction Decision Tree classification model and analyze the performance of engineering students based on their performances during secondary school education. The performance of students was analyzed and measured as a binomial response whether students successfully finished the first and the second study years. The developed model examined general success, number of awards obtained at competitions, special awards, average grades in mathematics, physics, and one of the official state languages during secondary school as predictor variables. The number of courses transferred from the first into the second study year and students’ GPA obtained during the first study year were added as predictor variables in the analysis and development of a prediction model for the students’ performance during the second study year and their enrollment in the third study year. Developed machine learning prediction model showed that for the performance of enrolled students in the first study year general success of students during secondary school is the most important predictor variable, followed by mathematics and physics grades. However, for the performance of the students enrolled in the second study year the most important predictor variable was number of the courses transferred from the first into the second study year, followed by students’ GPA obtained during the first study year and general success. Machine learning Decision Tree classification modeling was shown to be an adequate tool for the prediction of the performance of engineering students during the first and second study years. © The Author 2023.

An Effective Decision-Making Support for Student Academic Path Selection using Machine Learning;Houngue, Pélagie and Hountondji, Michel and Dagba, Théophile;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2022;Scopus;727 – 734;13;In Benin, after the GCSE (General Certificate of Secondary Education), learners can either enroll in a Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), or further their studies in the general education. Majority of those who take the latter path enroll in Senior High School by choosing the Biology stream or field of study. However, most of them do not have the abilities required to succeed in this field. For instance, for the last edition of the Senior Secondary Education Certificate (French baccalaureate) held in June 2022 in Benin, the Biology field of study had a low success rate of 42%. Therefore, one may consider that there is a problem in the orientation of the students. In recent years, Machine Learning has been used in almost every field to optimize processes or to assist in decision-making. Improving academic performance has always been of general interest. And, good academic performance implies good academic orientation. The goal of this study is to optimally help learners who have just obtained their GCSE to select their field of study. For this purpose, two major elements are predicted: i) Scientific or Literary ability of students, ii) Literature or Mathematics and Physical Sciences (MPS) or Biology stream of learners. More precisely, the average marks in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry Technology (PCT) and Biology from 6th to 9th grade for 325 students are used. Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Logistic Regression are used to predict learners’ ability and the stream. As a result, for learners’ ability prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 99% with the random forest algorithm for a split that reserved around 21% of the dataset for testing. As for the learners’ stream prediction, we obtained the best accuracy of 95% with the Linear SVC algorithm for a split that reserved around 20% of the dataset for testing. This study contributes to Educational Data Mining (EDM) by performing academic data exploration using numerous methods.

Assessing the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tutoring system for improving college-level mathematics preparedness in high school students;Nehring, Jenny and Moyer-Packenham, Patricia and North, Matt;Issues in Information Systems;2023;Scopus;128 – 141;24;Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) have been used to help high school students transition from the mathematics taught in high school to the mathematics expected at colleges and universities. The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between high school students’ performance in Assessment and LEarning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) Placement, Preparation, and Learning (PPL) Modules and performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. The participants in this study were 100 students from five high schools in the United States. Each student was placed into one of two groups: the ALEKS Group, who completed the ALEKS Pre-Calculus Learning Modules, and the Non-ALEKS Group, who did not complete the modules. Students’ scores were compared statistically to test for significant differences. The analysis included a 2x2 mixed ANOVA to measure how assignment of the modules affected exam scores. A logistic regression was used to assess differences between the two groups in placing into college algebra. A statistically significant difference was found in exam scores between the ALEKS Group and the Non-ALEKS Group which indicated that assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Learning Modules did increase performance on the ALEKS College Mathematics Placement Exam. Conversely, assignment to the ALEKS PPL Pre-Calculus Modules did not increase students’ likelihood of placing into College Algebra. The amount of time students spent taking the exam influenced student outcomes on the ALEKS Mathematics Placement exam. These results show that schools could implement Intelligent Tutoring Systems into their current mathematics classrooms to help students increase their scores on college entry mathematics placement exams. © 2023 International Association for Computer Information Systems.;Article;10.48009/1_iis_2023_111;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85174258672&doi=10.48009%2f1_iis_2023_111&partnerID=40&md5=9cb2f954457c2a8a3728fdf22c48027f;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"artificial intelligence; college mathematics preparation; intelligent tutoring systems; quantitative literacy education";Álgebra
What would the matrix do?: a systematic review of K-12 AI learning contexts and learner-interface interactions;Moore, Robert L. and Jiang, Shiyan and Abramowitz, Brian;Journal of Research on Technology in Education;2023;Scopus;7 – 20;55;This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence’s instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synthesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration. © 2022 ISTE.;Article;10.1080/15391523.2022.2148785;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85143170742&doi=10.1080%2f15391523.2022.2148785&partnerID=40&md5=4c1cfd0c62e570b7d2b0fb2105e2e1d6;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;artificial intelligence, machine learning;Álgebra
Predicting secondary school student performance using a double particle swarm optimization-based categorical boosting model;Fan, Zongwen and Gou, Jin and Wang, Cheng;Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence;2023;Scopus;;124;Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd;Article;10.1016/j.engappai.2023.106649;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85163036424&doi=10.1016%2fj.engappai.2023.106649&partnerID=40&md5=6f3a9d0f632d793745d02c8749a8c734;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"CatBoost; Double particle swarm optimization; Educational data mining; Educational management";Álgebra

Automated Matching of Exercises with Knowledge components;Tian, Zejie and Flanagan, Brendan and Dai, Yiling and Ogata, Hiroaki;30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings;2022;Scopus;24 – 32;1;As intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) fast develop, they have been implemented in many classrooms combing with various tutorial tools. Especially, matching exercises with knowledge components is the fundamental task of many applications, such as automatic recommendation, student knowledge tracing etc. However, manually labelling educational data is labor intensive and time consuming. Therefore, a range of machine learning methods has been proposed to address this problem, while few of them focusing on Japanese educational dataset in the real high school. In this paper, we leverage natural language processing techniques with Keyphrase extraction methods based on Japanese math exercises. We evaluate the model performance with several state-of-the-art methods and how it works in a real educational task.

Predicting the Performance of Mathematics' Students through Data Mining Techniques for Enhanced Education Systems;Mauricio, Jose and Marques, Goncalo;2021 1st Conference on Online Teaching for Mobile Education, OT4ME 2021;2021;Scopus;146 – 152;;In this study, we use data mining techniques to predict the performance of students in mathematics. The failure rate in secondary education within the discipline of mathematics is significant. Therefore, predicting the performance of students is relevant to support the decision plan on interventions. A dataset with 395 records collected from two secondary schools in Portugal was used in this work. The authors tested eight machine learning algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. Consequently, this work supports future research activities to use NB to predict students' performance. Moreover, this work has ranked the impact of the variables which most disturb students from achieving success. The results recommend the NB algorithm using the top five important features which report 75.22%, 74.41%, 75.22%, and 73,29% of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively. By predicting students' performance is possible to plan interventions on time and, consequently, increase the final discipline score. © 2021 IEEE.;Conference paper;10.1109/OT4ME53559.2021.9638819;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123867623&doi=10.1109%2fOT4ME53559.2021.9638819&partnerID=40&md5=75fd70f39da61ad1ef4a7fe1b387fc16;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Education, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Naïve Bayes, Students Performance;Estadística/Probabilidad
Low-achievement risk assessment with machine learning;Zanellati, Andrea and Zingaro, Stefano P. and Gabbrielli, Maurizio;CEUR Workshop Proceedings;2023;Scopus;461 – 465;3486;In this work, we propose a method for assessing the risk of low-achievement in secondary school with data collected from the Italian ministry of education. Low-achievement is a phenomenon whereby a student, despite completing his or her education, does not reach the level of competence expected by the school system. We train three machine learning models on a large, real dataset through the INVALSI large-scale assessment tests and compare the results in terms of predictive and descriptive performance. We exploit data collected in end-of-primary school mathematics tests to predict the risk of low-achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (5 years later). The promising results of our approach suggest that it is possible to generalise the methodology for other school systems and for different teaching subjects. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In this article, we present Gea 2: A New Earth, a digital SG developed as an immersive 3-D virtual learning environment, integrating several educational resources, including multimedia learning material, communication tools, and intelligent tutoring support. The game aims to complement traditional classroom activities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), for high school students and teachers. It incorporates an intelligent pedagogical agent that can converse in natural language with the student and provides unsolicited hints during gameplay. This article presents the game and its evaluation based on experiments involving about 100 participants. We think that the results presented here add to the research on game-based learning for STEM, by proposing a complex game system, where artificial intelligence techniques are integrated to support students' learning, and by confirming that the game experience can be attractive for the learners, also in very constrained classroom environments, such as those we operated in. © 2008-2011 IEEE.;Article;10.1109/TLT.2022.3143519;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85123353158&doi=10.1109%2fTLT.2022.3143519&partnerID=40&md5=31b4ae61ec9609b2fc49ba214c61a349;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Game-based learning, serious games (SGs), science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) edu cation, technology-enhanced learning (TEL).;Tutoría Inteligente
Identification of factors that affect the academic performance of high school students in Peru through a machine learning algorithm;Acosta, Lady Denisse Infante and Polo, Jonatán Edward Rojas;Proceedings of the LACCEI international Multi-conference for Engineering, Education and Technology;2021;Scopus;;2021-July;"The Peruvian Ministry of Education annually conducts the Student Census Evaluation (ECE, for its acronym in Spanish) to evaluate the level of learning achievement in the subjects of mathematics, reading and science and technology, both in public and private schools.

A case study of using AI for General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) grade prediction in a selective independent school in England;Denes, Gyorgy;Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence;2023;Scopus;;4;The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant challenges for UK schools, but a time of cancelled exams and uncertainty around future examinations can provide opportunities to explore novel assessment methods. Hence, the 2020 proposal of the Ofqual algorithm which combines teachers' estimated grades and schools' historical performance seemed timely. However, the algorithmically calculated grades resulted in a public backlash and withdrawal of the proposal. While the failed Ofqual algorithm could be considered an example of AI, we do not yet have a thorough understanding of its numerical accuracy and how it performs in comparison to other AI models. This paper investigates this novel application: the potential use of a range of AI models as assessment tools in a selective, independent, secondary school in England. The following questions were examined: (1) how accurate are modern AI models in predicting GCSE exam grades? (2) what are the differences in model accuracy across subjects and can these be explained by qualitative differences in teachers' grading practices? Results indicate that while models yield acceptable mean absolute errors, individual mispredictions can be larger than desired. Subject differences highlighted that grading subjectivity is less significant in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects, which could explain why objective models fail to predict non-STEM grades more frequently. In summary, numerical results indicate that grade prediction could be an interesting novel application of AI, but more research is needed to reduce outliers. © 2023 The Author(s);Article;10.1016/j.caeai.2023.100129;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85147343765&doi=10.1016%2fj.caeai.2023.100129&partnerID=40&md5=97768551a93b15f23b85c49fa084f997;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Grading; machine learning; grade prediction; examinations";Pensamiento Computacional
A Theoretical Framework for a Mathematical Cognitive Model for Adaptive Learning Systems;Sun, Siyu and Wu, Xiaopeng and Xu, Tianshu;Behavioral Sciences;2023;Scopus;;13;The emergence of artificial intelligence has made adaptive learning possible, but building an adaptive system requires a comprehensive understanding of students’ cognition. The cognitive model provides a crucial theoretical framework to explore students’ cognitive attributes, making it vital for learning assessment and adaptive learning. This study investigates 52 experts, including primary and secondary school teachers, mathematics education experts, and graduate students, based on the 16 cognitive attributes in the TIMSS 2015 assessment framework. Through an analysis of their attribute questionnaires, the Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method is used to construct a five-level mathematical cognitive model. The model is then revised through oral reports and expert interviews, resulting in a final cognitive model ranging from “memorize” to “justify”. The cognitive model describes the relationship between different attributes in detail, enabling the development of adaptive systems and aiding in the diagnosis of students’ cognitive development and learning paths in mathematics. © 2023 by the authors.;Article;10.3390/bs13050406;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85160247713&doi=10.3390%2fbs13050406&partnerID=40&md5=30aea551f1919e538eab8e82717304f9;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"adaptive learning system; cognitive model; interpretive structural modeling; mathematical learning";Evaluación/Predicción
Learning Factors for TIMSS Math Performance Evidenced Through Machine Learning in the UAE;Nadaf, Ali and Monroe, Samantha and Chandran, Sarath and Miao, Xin;Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies;2023;Scopus;47 – 66;154;Understanding how the UAE K12 education system performs with data-driven evidence is key to inform better policy making to support UAE vision to upskill human capital growth for its economic transformation. In this study, we investigate the potential of using machine learning techniques to understand key learning factors contributing to UAE student math performance on the TIMSS 2019 assessment. Due to the fact that learning factors co-exist and interact with one another, we explore the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach to explain the complexity of the model. The results highlight the importance and contributions of each learning factor and uncover the relationships between the learning factors. Understanding key learning factors and identifying evidence-based intervention opportunities will help policymakers with informed education intervention designs to improve student mathematics learning, in order to improve UAE student TIMSS math performance over the long run. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.;Book chapter;10.1007/978-981-19-8040-4_4;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85145773803&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-19-8040-4_4&partnerID=40&md5=a01467002c9db9a708b1ead17d0746ef;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"Learning factor analysis; Machine learning; SHAP values; TIMSS 2019; UAE K12 Education";Evaluación/Predicción
Design and Implementation of an Educational Game for Teaching Artificial Intelligence to High School Students;Wang, Ning and Montgomery, Ryan and Greenwald, Eric and Leitner, Maxyn;31st International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2023 - Proceedings;2023;Scopus;579 – 588;1;Artificial intelligence (Al) is becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives. In more and more fields, Al systems are transforming how knowledge is constructed, discoveries are realized, and how solutions are developed and tested. These changes have profound implications for the future workforce and citizenry. Yet, learning Al remains a niche subject largely reserved for advanced post-secondary educational contexts. While there is growing attention to broadening Al educational opportunities and, especially, to providing learning experiences for younger students, relatively little is currently known about how to most effectively provide Al education to K-12 (kindergarten through 12th grade) students. In this paper, we discuss the design and present findings from an implementation study of an educational game for high-school Al education called ARIN-561. Drawing on an integrated analysis of gameplay log data, pre/post knowledge, and disposition surveys for nearly 1.000 high school students, we present findings on the efficacy of the educational game and its constituent activities in advancing Al learning goals.

Developing computational thinking teaching strategies to model pandemics and containment measures;Araya, Roberto and Isoda, Masami and Moris, Johan van der Molen;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;2021;Scopus;;18;COVID-19 has been extremely difficult to control. The lack of understanding of key as-pects of pandemics has affected virus transmission. On the other hand, there is a demand to incor-porate computational thinking (CT) in the curricula with applications in STEM. However, there are still no exemplars in the curriculum that apply CT to real-world problems such as controlling a pandemic or other similar global crises. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing exemplars of CT for modeling the pandemic. We designed exemplars following the three pillars of the framework for CT from the Inclusive Mathematics for Sustainability in a Digital Economy (InMside) project by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC): algorithmic thinking, computational modeling, and machine learning. For each pillar, we designed a progressive sequence of activities that covers from elementary to high school. In an experimental study with elementary and middle school students from 2 schools of high vulnerability, we found that the computational modeling exemplar can be implemented by teachers and correctly understood by students. We conclude that it is feasible to introduce the exemplars at all grade levels and that this is a powerful example of Science Technol-ogy, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) integration that helps reflect and tackle real-world and challenging public health problems of great impact for students and their families. © 2021 by the authors.

Predicting Students' State Examination Results based on Previous Grades and Demographics;Pentel, Avar and Kaiva, Lisanne-Liis;IEEE;2020;Web Of Science;377--382;;All Estonia's upper-secondary school students have three mandatory final state examinations - in mathematics, Estonian language and foreign language. We used data obtained from one school in order to predict student's final examination scores based on previous grades and demographic data. Our aim was to find most important factors that contribute positively to final results and vice versa. Machine learning package Weka was used to build predictive models and with all tested attribute sets we got accuracy over 80\% on classification. On continuous models we got mean absolute error close or less to 10, when range of test result was 0-100 points. Most of our attributes were subject grades on scale 1-5, and therefore, as we limited our testing sample with one school only, it gave interesting insights into how some subjects and teachers do contribute to final test results. And, surprisingly, it turned out, that for some test result, most significant predictor was negatively correlated to the result. It means that having bad grades in some subjects was a good predictor of success in final test. Besides being a useful tool for students who want to estimate possible test results beforehand, it is also a useful tool for measuring teachers' contributions and relationships between different subjects.;Article;;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;"learning analytics; machine learning; final test result prediction.";Analítica/EDM

Secondary schools are increasing rapidly from past years and progress of the institution can be measured based on student's success and failure rates. Failure rates can be measured in terms of a core subject such as mathematics which has been considered in this proposed system. Real data was collected using school reports and questionnaire method by the Portugal school which has been used for the project. The students will be classified according to the grades assigned for the range of marks scored by them. This involves classifying the students into five levels of grading system starting from grade 'A' to grade 'F' where grade 'A' represents the student getting the highest marks, grade 'B' being the second highest, grade 'C' being third, grade 'D' being the fourth and the grade 'F' which implies that the student has failed. To carry out this type of classification many machine learning algorithms can be used to implement it. Comparison was made between the algorithms like Multiclass Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks using the Weka tool. Based on the analysis carried out Multiclass Support Vector Machine showed prominent accuracy. The Multiclass Support Vector Machine is implemented on the basis of one-to-rest strategy use of class labels which is primarily an extension of linear Support Vector Machine. In order to get appropriate results in terms of the accuracy of the model, parameters like 'C' and 'Gamma' is tuned while implementing Multiclass Support Vector Machine. The result gives a good predictive accuracy based on the grades that are provided by the school. The accuracy of prediction made by Support Vector Machine Classifier is determined by using K fold cross validation, according to which the accuracy is 89\%.;Article;;;The topic is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in mathematics education.;Accepted;Educational data miningMulticlass Support Vector MachineNeural Networks;Pensamiento Computacional
